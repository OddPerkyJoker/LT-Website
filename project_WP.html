	<h3> The Brief </h3>	

<p> <i> 
Using at least four projects, create a website portfolio showcasing you and your work. Include a 450 word About me, a contact page and a body of work, taking structure, hierarchy and usability into consideration.
 </i> </p>

<p>  My website portfolio is my own little corner of the internet displaying my work to all that visit, whether that be random visitors, clients, design agencies and people interested in my work. Regardless, thank you for visiting my website!

 	<h3> The Insight </h3>
<p>Coding a website is a very steep learning process so coding a website in a couple of weeks was no easy feat. That being said, Mark’s workshops were very useful in helping us develop our early website tests, helping us with layout and template design, looking at hierarchy and structure of content in my website and assisting with website navigation. </p>
<p>His workshops started in bite sized steps, going from basic coding to a basic website wireframe and then adding more complex code as we improved with each workshop. I also used one of my own resources to help me learn to code which I found really useful. “Web and digital for Graphic Designers” was a really useful source for website coding and design. It broke down and explained the HTML and CSS easily, demonstrating how to code different things step by step, with different HTML and CSS code to demonstrate different effects. Mark directed us to Codepen, which was also a very handy resource for looking at styles of code and visualising how the code works.
</p>

<p>When designing my website, I wanted to give it a sustainable, eco friendly feel. I felt this was important as I wanted the website to portray me, and as a designer, sustainability is a key part of my ethos so I’m not helping contribute to the further pollution of our planet. To get this sustainable feel, I focused on referencing it all throughout my about me copy and my projects. I also wanted to use a natural green colour scheme but thought it was a little on the nose and that the green sustainability trope was a bit overplayed, so I decided to use the next best thing, my favourite colour purple throughout my website. </p>

<h3> Coding Folder Structure</h3>
 	

	 <p> We started our coding project by learning the basics of code and how folders structures work. Each Website needs a starting page called “index.html”, which acts as your home page, from here you can add other .HTML files to create separate pages within your website. You can also add content folders such as images, media and fonts.

To help us visualise this hierarchy, we drew up our folder structure so we could reference it when creating our website wireframes.  </p>


	
	<h3> Content Structuring and layout</h3>
 	

	 <p> Content structure was an important part of my portfolio project. Designing a layout I liked took a long time and I'm still not fully happy with how it currently looks. I wanted to use a grid system to keep structure and conformity throughout my project pages and ended up deciding on a three column grid. I thought this was a clean and simple layout design that was quite flexible for layouts. I developed the layout grid more by adding a couple of other layout structures too like a full page width banner with an accent colour to highlight important information and draw the viewer's attention. I also added a couple of 1:2 and 2:1 ratio grids so that I could add more variety and flexibility to my body copy and imagery. I liked this layout grid overall as I thought it was simplistic yet effective with the couple varieties I added.

<h3> Fonts, colours, <span>imagery and media</h3>
 	

	 <p>
The design was an important aspect of my website. I wanted my website to feel welcoming and bright, so I tried using pale pastel colours for my page background with some deep purple colours to contrast my backgrounds. I also changed each project colour to fit with the projects themes which I liked as it added an extra variety of colour throughout my website instead of flooding the whole website with the same purple and pinks. 
 </p>
	<p> When including imagery and video, I wanted to use a variety of content in my projects to show a diversity in work, demonstrating my flexibility with projects. Although I used similar sustainability based projects, I think I showed a variety of work, including animation, coding, Branding and sustainability in projects.

	<h3> User Testing <span> feedback and reflection</h3>
 	

	 <p> The user feedback was a useful way to develop my website further and get some fresh perspective on my website. I found it useful looking at other peoples projects too, taking inspiration from others and helping each other with bits of code and how to tweak or add things. Although I found viewing other pupil’s websites, I felt the feedback wasn’t incredibly useful as my website was midway through development so a lot of the issues raised I was already aware of and had already planned how I would alter and fix these issues.  </p>

<p>My main feedback was mostly minor tweaks and changes I needed to make Like keeping image sizes consistent, an issue I had noticed but knew was only a matter of resizing my images so didn’t find it important to change at the time. Some of my images aren't loading which was just an issue with file size being too big so after reducing them and saving the images for Web, they all worked fine. A useful point I hadn't considered were my project images and how relevant they were to my project. I was advised that I should change some of my images to fit my project better, making sure that the images were clear and distinguishable to the project. 
</p>

<p> Apart from these minor tweaks, the feedback was all positive, I received positive feedback on my header styling and colour scheme. I was also commended for my layout design, particularly my Betty and Bruno and Sustainability Project layout which I also particularly liked. My about page was also commented on as they thought the rotating images was a nice touch. I really liked the moving images and agreed that it was a strong aspect of the website

A coding challenge I overcame was in the about me section of my website. The cycling image container worked initially but would always skip through photos every couple of seconds, flicking back and forth between them and creating a glitchy distortion. I spent hours combing through the code, tweaking and changing, wondering what I did wrong. Couldn’t figure it out and decided to leave it but managed to overcome this problem by turning the images into a repeating GIF and using that instead of the complicated code slideshow that kept breaking. This was an example of where I could have been more time efficient with my project, focusing on more important areas of my portfolio such as the layout design and content copy for my projects.

	</p>

<p> Overall I think I worked well in this project. I feel I managed to learn coding quite quickly given the timeframe and believe my website has a clear navigational structure, clear typographical hierarchy while still maintaining a slightly unique style on each page. I think the use of different project colours worked nicely to differentiate my projects and bring a pop of new colour into my purple website. 
	</p>
	
	<p> If I were to do it again, I’d work in my time management, starting my projects earlier, and not spending hours trying to fix minor issues with my website when there are important areas that still need development or are missing altogether. I felt there were some points where I took too much time looking for a specific line of code or trying to figure out what the problem with a section of my website was. I should have focused on the most important aspects of my website first like my copy, project content and layout and structure, instead of refining everything, trying to make it all perfect as I went. 
	</p>
	
	<p> Despite the time management issues, I still believe my website turned out well and I am happy with the quality of my website. If I had more time I would refine my layout further to look more interesting in areas where layouts start to repeat.
