<h3>
Having to design for a world without fossil fuels,
we thought about how we interact with our produce. </h3>
<p> We came up with a couple different ideas including
using the ocean to grow produce on large floating
islands, providing space for nature to regenerate
and heal from our distruction. </p>

<p> We also thought about creating large growing systems,
huge buildings designed to grow different produce
on each floor, alowing for communities to grow diverse
crops from their local area, ending the need for food
distribution and intense farming practises around
the globe. </p>

<p>We also thought about how communities could
accommodate growing spaces within their cities
and thought of a couple of ideas including, introducing
urban greening to cities, vertical farming in buildings,
communal gardens and home growing spaces.
We liked the idea of having commmunities work
together to produce local food, taking what they need
for themselves and sharing the rest with the community,
reducing food waste, co2 emissions from distribution
and making intense farming apractise of the past,
encouraging nature to heal and regrow. </p>
<p> As much as we liked these ideas, we decided to focus
on the community route, as we felt it was the best
outcome for our project, and created the biggest
positive impact on the planet. <p>
<h4> This became the basis for our <br> Self Sustaining Society. </h4>

 <h3>Initial Research</h3> 

<p> Current perceptions: 250 million google results, featured in most brunch menus. Hashtags like avocado feature 8 millionposts on instagram. Millenials increase demand
and imports by 21%, hitting 4.82 billion between 2012 and 2016, due to praise for their health benefits. </p>

<p> UK VirginTrains started an Avocard marketing campaign, selling railcards by giving 26 to 30’s avocado discounts on train tickets. </p>

<p> Avocado toast is seen as a luxury, expensive product due to high demand. Avocados associate with the beauty and self-care industry due to its richvitamin content. Instagram popularised fruit and food adverts funded by organisations that back certain food economics. <p>

<p> A kilogram of avocados require 0.75 tons of water, roughly 7x more than bananas. </p>

<p>A report by Global Forest Watch states that 98% of deforestation in Mexico is due to agricultural expansion. The report also covers trees lost to fire, with 340Kha of land lost to fire outbreaks in 2021.  This record is relatively normal given that about 3.8Mha of land was lost to fire eruptions in 2011. </p>
<p> Over 40,000 deforestation alerts were recorded in
Mexico between the 26th July and 2nd August 2022. <p>


<p>We used the post growth toolkit to help
us with further idea generation.
We found this a useful tool to help us
identify the key areas where avocados
were creating issues, realising that
overconsumption of resources due to a
booming avocado economy and the
inequality and exploitation of communities
were the key problem areas. </p>


<p> This was useful as it helped us refine the
areas we wanted to develop, helping
us find our new direction for our project,
as we looked further into avocados
overconsumption of resources and
finding ways to tackle these important
issues. </p>

<p>Aztecs and Avocados:
Aztecs believed Avocados gave them
strength, love and it promoted fertility.
The word avocado came from their word
for ‘testicles’, and it was supposedly
named this due to it’s aphrodisiac
properties. They also believed it
resembles a female uterus or a growing
fetus, as they also take aproximately
9 months to grow. </p>

<p> Nowadays, they are a source of folic acid,
and women who are trying to conceive,
are advised to get this mineral.
Mayas and Avocado:
Avocado trees had and important spiritual
purpose in their culture, they believed
ancestors were reborn in trees and those
bearing fruit were especially protected. </p>

<p>Modern day Belize, used to be called the avocado kingdom in Mayan history.
Avocados were illustrated in the 14th
month of Mayas’ calendar and had an
important role in mythology. <p>

<h3> Final Evaluation</h3>
</section>

<section class="multigrid">
<div class="ca">
<p>Overall I really enjoyed this project and thought it went well. I loved exploring the sustainability aspect of it, as
I like designing for positive
change and a better future.
I believe we managed
to create a plausible
outcome that could create
positive change for future
generations. </p>

<p> I believe we all worked well
together as a team, dividing
the work evenly and
collaborating effectively in a
team. We all collaborated
throughout the project,
having a large amount of
input at each design stage. </p>

<div class="cb">

<p> If I were to do the project
again, I would like to work on my time and
project management skills,
setting realistic goals for
the work I produce as I found that I spent lots of
time on things that I didn’t use like the 3D infographic.
We also didn’t have long to create our presentations and I felt we rushed the first one, but managed to improve the
second presentation a lot.
It would have been nice to develop our early avocado
tree idea further, making an interactive final outcome, or explore after effects further
to design an interactive
infographic, but overall,
I believe we did well with the time we had and I think our outcome was created
to a high standard and
professional quality. </p>

</div>

<div class="cc">

<p> 
If we had more time, I would have liked to refine the letter a little further,
removing any little impurities
on the design. Overall though, I am prod of our project and final outcome.
We worked efficiently
together and had a good work dynamic, managing to get a lot done with our time. </p>
