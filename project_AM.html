	<h3> The Brief </h3>	

<p> <i> How can we make people see the importance of recycling? </i> </p>

<p>  Using research as a starting point, create a short motion sequence animation that addresses a social issue of your choice in some way. 
</p> 

<p <big>  A birds eye view </big> is a short sequence animation, all about plastic pollution. It follows a journey between two unlikely friends, depicting the effects of plastic pollution on our oceans and wildlife along the way. An impactful short film, the sequence aims to provoke a necessary change in societal views, taking a more positive approach to recycling and plastic waste.

<h3> Scripting</h3>

<p>When developing the script, we wanted to incorporate our information into the story. 
Using key facts that piqued our interest, we used information such as the effects of plastic pollution on ocean ecosystems, the decline of vital oxygen-producing sea plankton, and the contamination that breached our oceans, becoming the Great Pacific Garbage Patch.
</p>

<p>I took inspiration from this and started visualising a sequence through a dirty beach and into a contaminated sea, an idea we’d develop further. I wanted to include our facts in the narrative but didn’t want it becoming too information heavy, so we decided to use a couple of our most important facts throughout the scenes, overtop the sounds of the sea and wildlife.
</p>

<p>We wanted to have a resolve to the animation, so researched companies and charities working to prevent plastic pollution that we could direct the audience to. We found Surfers Against Sewage and Leave only footprints to be the two most relevant organisations to reference, as they both provide important beach and ocean cleanup as well as useful ways for people to help out.

<h3> Storyboarding </h3>

<p> With these two characters established, we then thought about what they would do. I first thought we could follow the girl through the recycling process but we thought that wouldn’t be engaging enough so thought about other ways we could show the impact. We thought about the bird and how we could have it fly around over the sea, seeing all the damage caused to the ocean  and have it interact with the girl in some way but wasn’t sure how. 
	Eventually I thought about how to make the two interact, and thought the bird could transform the girl into one, taking her along the journey and showing her the pollution she also contributes to. 
	</p>

<p> We put together the animatic and liked how it looked so decided to do a couple of animation tests using Polina's artwork to see how the animation could look in her style. </p>

<p> When developing the storyboard, we thought about how we could best visualise the impact of our research in an animation. We took the key areas we wanted to address and built the narrative from there. We knew we wanted to include something related to climate change and the impact of recycling so took these as our initial inspirations. </p>

<p> I thought it would be a good idea to combine the effect on ocean life and the recycling process to show the audience their impacts and how to solve it. We liked this idea but decided that there were more interesting ways to tell the story than through the recycling process and felt it would become too infographic and educational. I then had the idea of making the narrative follow the unlikely friendship of a girl and a bird. I preferred this idea as I thought the two characters worked well to represent mankind and nature, and could be used to help visualise our research and bring it into the story. </p>

 <div class="cc"> <h3> Animation Tests</h3> 
 
 <p> Once we were happy with the storyboard we looked at animation styles we wanted to use. </p>
 
 <p> Originally I wanted to use vector based artwork to keep our art style simple, crisp and clean. I would have liked to create a couple mockups but instead we decided to go with a more illustrative art style to help add detail and emotion to our scenes. I liked this new art style although it made animation harder as we had to work harder to make the scenes look realistic and some detailed scenes took a long time to draw. </p>
 
 <p> As we were happy with our initial animation tests, we decided to move on and continue developing the full animation in this style. </p>

<section> </section>
<h3> After Effects Workshop </h3>

<p> One of the most important workshops, the After effects tutorials were incredibly vital for learning how to animate our project in time. Learning After Effects in a couple weeks is no easy feat, but Ben’s animation workshops made learning to animate easier to understand. 
</p>


<p> We went through things like rotoscoping, keyframing an object and different animation techniques  for animating text and assets in different ways. I found the rotoscoping workshop very useful as we incorporated it in our animation. I rotoscoped the side on flight of a bird flying and found that using the rotoscope technique was much smoother and effective for animating our flight scenes compared to guessing each frame placement from memory. The quality of the rotoscoped animation is much smoother than that of the non-rotoscope sequence. 
</p>

<p> We also participated in a hand drawn frame by frame animation workshop. I found this fun to experiment with, trying to make each frame look realistic by playing with spacing and distance to make the bouncing ball animation look realistic. The workshop also introduced some of the key principles of animation such as squash and stretch to emphasise speed and object mass, anticipation to add realism in animation, staging to control where the audience is looking,  preventing having lots of visuals happening at once and slow in and slow out to make movement look more realistic by easing into and out of their motion.

<div class="ca"> 



<h3> 	Storyboard Workshops </h3> <p> A key workshop for our initial idea development, the storyboard workshop helped us identify key areas of our narrative and how to storyboard quickly and efficiently so no time is wasted animating scenes that don’t look right or won’t be used.
</p>

</div>

<div class="cb"> 

<h3>Sound Design </h3> <p> Another key workshop, the sound design workshop illustrated the importance of sounds in animation. Visuals and sounds are as important as one another in animations, as the visuals and audio can influence the narrative and audience. We also learnt the importance of sound mixing and keeping all our audio levels at a safe volume to not damage the viewer’s hearing.

<h3> Scratching on Film Workshop </h3> <p> This allowed us to work with frame by frame animation as well ascomparing different frame rates and how different FPS speeds affect video playback speed.

	<p> Although challenging, the animation project was a really fun and engaging brief that pushed our skills to the extreme, having to research, generate ideas,  design, and  learn to animate from scratch. I really liked how our project and how the animation turned out, although if I had the chance to do it again, I would improve a couple things throughout the project. </p>

<p>At the beginning of the project I found myself naturally taking on a team leader role. I believe as I already had the creative vision for this project and done some prior research, I had a good idea of what the animation would look like and could instruct the team as necessary. The group all seemed happy with this, asking for advice and visual direction with their illustrations and animations. </p>

<p>Creating a big impact on our project performance, organisation and time management were two important factors we could have improved on. Our animation style created a heavy workload for the illustration and animation, as detailed scenes took a long time to draw and animating scenes to look realistic meant more precision was needed in the animation stage. Due to this heavy demand we should have scheduled our weeks so that work was completed on time and we didn’t fall behind on our project. Unfortunately due to the heavy illustration process, scene assets were slow to release and animation fell behind as we had no assets to use to create the next scene. </p>

<p>Although this lost us precious animating time, it allowed Jack and I the time to develop our storyboards further, refine the sequence and adapt our script so our time wasn’t wasted.  </p>

<p>I believe if we went down the vector illustration route, we would have completed the animation quicker as the whole group could work on illustrations and animation together instead of relying on the 2 illustrator and 2 animator split we went with. </p>


<p> Throughout the project I really enjoyed the animation process. I enjoyed learning the new program and bringing once still objects to life with animation! I’d like to develop this skill further, experimenting with more animation styles, techniques and even some Cinema 4D and Blender for 3D Modelling. </p>

 <p> Throughout the project I attended some wonderful workshops and seminars. Some key visits that stuck out to me were the Eleven Miles trip, providing useful portfolio hints and tips as well as some layout and design pointers. I also enjoyed  the visit from Tim Varlow and the creative agency, 20ten. </p>

 <p> Dan was really insightful when he visited from 20ten. He had various useful portfolio and design tips such as including some of my process in my portfolio so people can see how I develop ideas and overcome challenges. He also mentioned keeping my portfolio projects centred around the design I want to do which I took into account when picking the projects for my website project, as I wanted to centre my portfolio theme around my sustainability ethos which I think I achieved quite successfully with the use of my about me content and the projects I chose. </p>

<p>I believe our team initially worked well together, meeting up in the mornings to discuss our project, which direction we wanted to take it, discussing scenes that needed illustrating and animating etc. however I believe that once we fell into that rhythm and everyone knew what that were working on, team members joined meetings less frequently and discussions weren’t happening so work production started to slow further. </p>

<p>I feel the illustration  animation split was unfair, as it meant that animation relied solely on Jack and I. As I was most proficient with after effects in the group, it also meant  that I became responsible for most of the animation sequences as well as being project lead, giving art direction, developing the narrative and sequence and the script. </p>

<p>I think the team’s roles were unevenly split and more equality in roles would have lead to a more even and easier  workload for all of us, helping us complete the project to the deadline. </p>

<p>Overall I believe that the detailed animation style was necessary to our project as it allowed us to incorporate more detail in our animation which helps build emotion in the scenes. </p>
